# Healthcare ETL Portfolio

## Purpose
This repository showcases end-to-end ETL/ELT (extract, transform, load / extract, load, transform) and data modeling workflows built to support analytics, reporting, and decision-making use cases in a healthcare context.

The project(s) here demonstrate how I design, build, and maintain analytics-ready datasets using SQL, R, Python, dbt and other technologies. While the examples here are healthcare-focused and informed by real-world workflows I've supported professionally, the patterns and techniques are broadly applicable across industries. 

This repository is actively under development and reflects an evolving analytics engineering portfolio.

## Data Sources
All data used in this repository is either:
- Fully synthetic and generated for demonstration purposes, or
- Publicly available datasets cited from it's source within the project documentation

*No proprietary, PHI, or confidential data is used.*

## Project Focus Areas
- ETL/ELT pipeline design and orchestration
- Data transformation and analytics modeling
- SQL-based data validation and quality checks
- dbt models and testing
- Analytics-ready datasets for Business Intelligence (BI) and downstream analysis

Additional projects and documentation will be added as development continues.
