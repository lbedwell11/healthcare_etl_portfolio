# Healthcare ETL Portfolio

## Purpose
This repository (aka repo) was created to help showcase my ETL/ELT (extract, transform, load / extract, load, transform) and modeling skills as an analytics engineer via projects using R and Python. The sources and processes here are targeted towards a healthcare focus that I've either worked on or have wanted to build up projects for, but these processes can be translated towards other industries as well.

## Data Sources
Because this repo is public, all data used here is fake, made up by myself or otherwise cited from it's source.
